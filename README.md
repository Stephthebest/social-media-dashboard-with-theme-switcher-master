## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I was finally able to use basic level grid. I will continue to update my code to see where i potentially missed any CSS properties that can help my design or even remove CSS properties that are not useful or contribute to the design. I recently just started Javascript freeCodeCamp course. All though i have learned basic Javascript in the past i still struggled with changing the styles for the toggle button dark theme. I will also continue to update my code to write cleaner and better Javascript.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-make-a-toggle-button-using-checkbox-and-css/) - This helped me with making the toggle button function and designing the button. There where other tutorials but this one is the one that worked best for me.
